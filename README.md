### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a purpose-driven researcher who is eager to contribute to a rapid transition into a low carbon, resilient, and just society.

In my journey of finding ways to make a difference, I have used models and simulations to tackle problems like bioremediation, bioplastic production, [water provision in a mega-city](https://github.com/comses/megadapt), and disease epidemics in [agroforestry-based coffee growing systems](https://github.com/manuvanegas/SpatialRust). In all, I accrue 7+ years of experience modeling biological and socio-ecological systems. I have developed a unique skillset that mixes micro/biology and ecology literacy with spatially-explicit agent-based modeling, parallel computing, container technologies, scripting languages, and quantitative analysis of large datasets.

I am an effective learner that enjoys solving puzzles, thinking in systems, and creating solutions. Currently, I am looking for opportunities where I can apply and grow my skills to help address the climate crisis.

### Current Projects

#### Promoting adoption of containerization technologies

As part of [CoMSES Net](https://www.comses.net/) and its goal of supporting transparent, interoperable, and reusable scientific computation in the study of complex social and ecological systems, I have contributed with content and tools to advance the adoption of containerization technologies in the computational modelling community. We published a peer-reviewed [article](https://doi.org/10.18174/sesmo.18074) introducing containerization concepts to the socio-environmental modeling community and are developing a series of GitHub-based containerization tutorials (see the [Containerizing an R Model](https://classroom.github.com/a/DBRL-FNw) and [Containerizing an NetLogo Model](https://classroom.github.com/a/WuDb62qc) classrooms).

#### Modeling the effect of agroforestry on epidemic outcomes and coffee farm profitability

As part of my ongoing doctoral research (defense planned for Spring, 2023), I developed [SpatialRust](https://github.com/manuvanegas/SpatialRust), a spatially-explicit agent-based model. SpatialRust simulates the development of Coffee Leaf Rust in a coffee farm under conventional or agroforestry-based farm management approaches. Epidemic outcomes are contrasted with the financial implications of each tested strategy to find management patterns that are more likely to maximize the farm's profitability. Currently, I am expanding the spatial extent of the simulations to cover more than one farm with the intent to study the collective action problem given by the potential trade-off between short-term profits and beneficial Coffee Leaf Rust management strategies.
